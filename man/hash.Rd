\title{Convert sequences to MD5 hashes.}
\usage{
hash(x, cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a sequence or list of sequences, either in character string,
character vector, or raw byte format (eg DNAbin or AAbin objects).}

\item{cores}{integer giving the number of CPUs to parallelize the operation
over. Defaults to 1, and reverts to 1 if \code{x} is not a list.
This argument may alternatively be a 'cluster' object,
in which case it is the user's responsibility to close the socket
connection at the conclusion of the operation,
for example by running \code{parallel::stopCluster(cores)}.
The string 'autodetect' is also accepted, in which case the maximum
number of cores to use is one less than the total number of cores available.
Note that in this case there
may be a tradeoff in terms of speed depending on the number and size
of sequences to be processed, due to the extra time required to initialize
the cluster.}
}
\value{
a character vector.
}
\description{
This function converts DNA or amino acid sequences to 128-bit
   MD5 hash balues for efficient identification of duplicates.
}
\details{
This function uses the \code{md5} function from the OpenSSL library
  (\url{https://www.openssl.org/})
  to digest sequences to 128-bit hashes.
  These can be compared using base functions such
  as \code{duplicated} and \code{unique}, for fast identification and
  management of duplicate sequences in large datasets.
