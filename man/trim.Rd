\title{Trim primers.}
\usage{
trim(x, up, down = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a "DNAbin" object or a vector of concatenated upper-case character strings,
representing the sequences to be trimmed.}

\item{up, down}{"DNAbin" objects or  vectors of concatenated upper-case character strings,
representing the primer sequences.}
}
\value{
a "DNAbin" object or a vector of concatenated character strings,
  depending on the input.
}
\description{
This function trims the primer sequence(s) from a set of DNA sequences.
}
\details{
Any sequences not containing the primer(s) in either direction are discarded.
  Hence this function can also be used to de-multiplex sequences and remove indices,
  though it will generally be faster to do this on the sequencing platform prior to
  exporting the FASTQ files.
