\title{Write sequences to text in FASTA or FASTQ format.}
\usage{
writeFASTQ(x, file = "", ...)

writeFASTA(x, file = "", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list of sequences in \code{DNAbin} or \code{AAbin} format, or a
vector of sequences as concatenated upper-case character strings.
For writeFASTQ, only DNAbin objects are accepted, and each element should have
a vector of quality scores of equal length attributed to the sequence.
These vectors are comprised of raw bytes ranging from 00 to 5d
(0 to 93 when converted to integers).
See \code{\link{readFASTQ}} for more details.}

\item{file}{character string giving a valid file path to output the text to.
If file = "" (default setting) the text file is written to the
console.}

\item{...}{further options to be passed to \code{cat} (not including \code{"sep"}).}
}
\value{
NULL (invisibly).
}
\description{
These functions take a list of DNA or amino acid sequences in
  \code{DNAbin} or \code{AAbin} format
  and outputs a text file to a specified directory.

  ## download example FASTQ file

  jgHCO2198 <- "TAIACYTCIGGRTGICCRAARAAYCA"
  x <- trim(x, up = mlCOIintF, down = jgHCO2198)
  ## quality filter with size selection and singleton removal
  x <- qfilter(x, minlength = 250, maxlength = 350)
  ## output filtered FASTQ file
