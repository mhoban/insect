\title{Split a group of sequences into subsets with maximum differentiation.}
\usage{
partition(x, model = NULL, needs_training = FALSE, K = 2,
  allocation = "cluster", refine = "Viterbi", iterations = 50,
  seqweights = "Gerstein", quiet = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{"DNAbin"} object containing multiple sequences in a list.}

\item{model}{an optional profile hidden Markov model as the hypothetical
data generating mechanism for the entire sequence set. This is used to
provide the starting parameters to train the top level models.}

\item{needs_training}{logical indicating whether the profile hidden Markov model
provided above (if applicable) should be trained before attempting to
split the sequence set, using the sequences supplied in \code{x}.
Only necessary if \code{"model"} is not NULL.}

\item{K}{integer. The number of groups to split the sequences into.}

\item{allocation}{integer vector giving the initial group membership of the
sequences. The vector length should be the same as that of the sequence set
\code{x}, and all elements should take values between 1 and K.
Alternatively, the character string "cluster" is accepted. In this case
sequences are initially allocated to K groups using K-means clustering.
This is the default option.}

\item{refine}{the method used to train/refine the models. Valid methods
are "Viterbi" (Viterbi training; default) and "BaumWelch" (a modified
version of the E-M algorithm).}

\item{iterations}{integer giving the maximum number of training-classification
iterations to be used in the splitting process (see details section).
Note that this is not necessarily the same as the number of Viterbi training
or Baum Welch iterations to be used in model training, which can be set
using the argument \code{"maxiter"} (eventually passed to
\code{\link[aphid]{train}} via the dots argument "...").}

\item{seqweights}{either NULL (default; all sequences are given an equal
weight of 1), a numeric vector the same length as \code{x} representing
the sequence weights used to derive the model, or a character string giving
the method to derive the weights from the sequences. Currently only the
\code{"Gerstein"} method is supported (the default). For this method, a
tree is first created by k-mer counting (see
\code{\link[phylogram]{kdistance}}),
and sequence weights are derived from the tree using the 'bottom up'
algorithm of Gerstein et al. (1994). The sum of these weights are equal
to the number of sequences in the alignment (so that mean(seqweights) = 1;
Note this does not need to be the case if providing weights as a numeric
vector).}

\item{quiet}{logical indicating whether the progress should be printed to
the console.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to \code{"aphid::train"} (not
including 'inserts').}

Finds the best split of a set of DNA sequences and provides a profile
